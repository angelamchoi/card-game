# Matching Card Game - General Assembly - SEI Project 1

Matching card game is a browser based verison with a mulitplication twist. This browser based game was created for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) Program.

## Inspiration for the game
As a former math teacher, I wanted to build an engaging and purposeful game to inspire students to practice their multiplication facts while having fun. 

## Technologies Used
The matching card game uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Getting Started
To play, access the browser based game here:

Match the correct cards before the time runs out. When there is a correct match, the user will solve a multiplication problem and will recieve extra points. Enjoy your daily dose of math :)

Good luck!

## Next Steps 
The follow are the next steps in improving the matching card game:

- Allow players to save their progress when they return back to their game
- Include different levels such as medium and difficult
- Make it responsive
	
## Development Process
To provide insight of how the browser based game was developed, this section will cover the following topics:

1. Project Requirements
2. Wireframe
3. Psuedocode
4. Reflection / Difficulties Faced
5. Content of the Working Version


### 1. Project Requirements
The objective of the project was to create a browswer based game and include some, if not all, of the topics in the first unit (Front-End Development) of the SEI Program

- Fundamentals of JavaScript
- Fundamentals of HTML
- Fundamentals of CSS
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- MVC Model
- CS Flexbox, Grid and Responsive Design
- Callback Functions
- Classes
- 'this' keyword
- Array Iterator Methods


### 2. Wireframe
Before building the game, I created a mockup for the browseer based game. I used Wireframe Pro to create the mockup. 

### 3. Pseudocode
After creating a mockup, I began to pseudocode. The following is pseudocode that was written before building the game. Pseudocode allowed me to think through each step of building my game and think deeply how on how the user will be interacting with the game. It also reminded me of lesson planning when I was a teacher and thinking through from introducing to lesson to incoporating indepdent practice time for students. I followed this template to aid me in structuring an organized process.

### 4. Reflection / Diffculties Faced
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed building my game. 

Things I enjoyed:
- Game logic
- generatoring random mulitplication problems 
- Various solutions
	- I love that there are variety of solutions to solving a coding problem. There are efficient and clean ways of writing code. Building my game has taught me to find a solution that works best for me and that I can understand. I will continue to work towards crafting a cleaner and more efficient code.

Difficulties faced
- Data Structure
	- My biggest takeaway from building my game is that data structure is incredibly important. There are so many moving pieces and information and the way you architect your code from the beginning is crucial. This experience has taught further my knowledge in organzing data.
- Positioning Random Pictures
	- This part was challenging for me.
	- I used Fisher Yates Algorithm to help me randomly position my cards. 
- Start small and then scale up
	- I learned that I need to start small with 4 cards and make it work.
